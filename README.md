Such a great wiki page which is practical

1. edit with markup language which is compatible with "wike-js'
2. can publish public tag by mass discussion
3. can use public tag to search document
4. provide version control function at document( comfirm of many people make version valid )
5. search data correlation periodically and link each other at the page.
